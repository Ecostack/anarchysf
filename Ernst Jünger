Jünger himself seems a rather remarkable author, with a career spanning the whole period of German history from the era of the Kaiser right through to post-reunification in the 1990s; the author died aged 102.

<i>Eumeswil </i>dates from his later life. It&#39;s undeniably sf, but is pretty demanding on the reader, and far indeed from the pulpier end of the market. The novel is written in the first person by a historian, living in a city state in a future after a &quot;world civil war&#39;&quot;; the state, Eumeswil, is essentially a dystopian dictatorship, where the narrator is himself part of the dictator&#39;s inner circle. The narrative is of explicit anarchist interest, and it&#39;s clear that the author was very familiar with many aspects of the anarchist history of the last two centuries. In particular the influence of Max Stirner&#39;s 
individualist anarchism is marked. But the narrator, and presumably the author, is keen to draw a distinction between what he sees as the &#39;anarchist&#39;, and his self-characterisation as an &#39;anarch&#39;; this he sees as going with the territory: &quot;Every born historian is more or less an anarch. . . .&quot; But to me Jünger&#39;s anarch seems closer to Nietzsche than to Stirner: more <i title="German language text" lang="de">Übermensch </i>than <i title="German language text" lang="de">Einzige</i>.
