The war is not quite forever, but lasts over a thousand  years, and is entirely witnessed, thanks to relativistic effects, by one  trooper; the war (against the Taurans) is unsurprisingly shown to have been  entirely pointless.
 
_The Forever War_ was compared by P.S.,  in the Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review in 1978, with Harrison's  _Bill, the Galactic Hero_, both books being condemned—unfairly, although  Haldeman's experience as a Vietnam combat veteran means that his descriptions of  warfare sometimes obscure his anti-militarist message. Reviewed and recommended  by <a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/books/the-forever-war-by-joe-haldeman"> Margaret Killjoy</a> in 2014.
