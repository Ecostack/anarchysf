Non-statist libertarian utopia. Berneri comments  that _Freeland_ was received with great enthusiasm in the UK, and Nettlau,  in 1897, included these works among "les utopies [ . . . ] non étatistes et où  se retrouvent des tendances libertaires" . . . . According to Nettlau the  anarchist Gustav Landauer was a Freelander when young. (Nettlau 1897, 1964)
