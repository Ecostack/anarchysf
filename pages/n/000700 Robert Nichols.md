_Daily Lives_ is a short tetralogy, set in a near-future alternate-world central Asian land. Strong on ecological and (unusually) traditional-religious values, the anarchist influence is explicitly acknowledged. Written in a fragmented, poetic and impressionistic style, it's an interesting and important modern utopia. _Daily Lives_ is preceded by an introductory work, _Red Shift_, in  which characters include 'Errico Malatesta' and 'Sandy Berkman'.
 
"While _Daily Lives_ is not widely  known, it is one of the most important contributions to both literary  and theoretical utopianism." (Clark 2009: 21-2) It was a significant  influence on Ursula K. Le Guin, who is on record as saying that " . . .  Nghsi-Altai is in some respects the very place I was laboriously trying  to get to, and yet lies in quite the opposite direction . . .". (Le Guin  1982)
