Lieffe comes to SF with an unusual and rather refreshing perspective. The novel (the first in a trilogy) presents a not-too-distant future dystopia in which the LGBTQ+ community, sex workers, and disabled people are centre stage in the Resistance.

_Anarchist Studies_ published an extended <a href="https://anarchiststudies.noblogs.org/article-survival-is-an-act-of-resistance-an-interview-with-kes-otter-lieffe/?fbclid=IwAR0WJP22h59ArGZsn99-zhODi9azhzA7r3fOlxIqqAVVMT0ppHAdTPPLLUM">interview</a> with the author in January 2021. The extent to which her work can be described as anarchist is explicitly discussed; rather evading the word, she replied "I mean, if book shops create a ‘radical, sex work positive, trans feminist, speculative fiction’ genre section just for my work, I’m okay with that." However, the discussion makes it clear that her intention was to present visions of a revolution that people could relate to:

"The revolution is absolutely made up of people and their contributions and their agency. It’s a lot of meetings and processing dynamics and drinking tea around a fire trying to figure out how to care for each other and meet our material needs. Every time we solve our conflicts without calling the cops, we are living a part of prison abolition. Every time we find ways to care for each other and hold on to each other in a culture centred on disposability, we are growing the revolution. In that sense, I think the revolution is the central story here and not the context."
