Included on a number of lists linked to by posters on Facebook's Solarpunk Anarchists, Sci-Fi Libertarian Socialist, Anarcho-Transhumanism, and Anarchism and 
Science Fiction Forum pages, as significant feminist writing with a message of social justice and diversity. At the Facebook Anarchist Studies Network page 
Melanie Rose called Jemisin the "Best scifi writer on the market right now and I love her books. So refreshing and brilliantly written." Jesse Cohn, replying, 
said "It's amazingly good. A landmark."
