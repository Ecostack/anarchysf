In his 1964 essay on political attitudes in SF Brunner  envisaged an automated anarchistic society as a possibility work exploring in SF  (Brunner 1964: 125). Interviewed in 1979, he said that  "if you had to classify me, you'd have to put me in some vague area like 'fellow-travelling idealistic anarchist.'"  (Platt: 276)

For Lessa, Takver & Alyx, writing in <em>Open Road</em> in 1978, the  "anarchist city Precipice" of <em>The Shockwave Rider</em> "appears like a jewel in a sea of horror". (13) Congenial and professedly anti-authoritarian as Precipice may be, it can't fairly be described as anarchist, given that it supports sheriff, mayor, courts, lawyers, and a judicial code with mandatory sentences.
