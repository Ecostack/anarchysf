This popular series showcases an implicitly anarchist post-scarcity society, enabled by nanotechnology.  Banks himself said, of the Culture, "Essentially, the contention is that our  currently dominant power systems cannot long survive in space; beyond a certain  technological level a degree of anarchy is arguably inevitable and anyway  preferable." More specifically, he argued that "the mutuality of dependence  involved in an environment which is inherently hostile would necessitate an  internal social coherence which would contrast with the external casualness  typifying the relations between such ships/habitats. Succinctly; socialism  within, anarchy without." Politically, "one of the few rules the Culture adheres  to with any exactitude at all is that a person's access to power should be in  inverse proportion to their desire for it." [<a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm">'A Few  Notes on the Culture'</a>]
 
According to the 2014 <em>Bottled Wasp Pocket  Diary</em> "A non-anarchist, he has been one of the few such to approach  depicting a real (if imaginary) anarchist society with any conviction or  accuracy, although a significant number of anarchists might dispute that  statement."
 
Of <em>Look to Windward</em>,  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_To_Windward">Wikipedia</a> notes "This book deals with the  themes of exile, bereavement, religious justification of mass violence against  humanity/sentience in war, and the mores associated with life within a  technologically and energetically unlimited anarchist utopia."
 
All these novels are included in Zeke Teflon's<a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Favorite Anarchist Science Fiction Novels</a>, though he particularly recommends <em>The Player of Games</em> and <em>Surface Detail</em>. <a href="http://syndicalist.us/2013/07/11/anarchist-science-fiction/">McKay</a> enjoyed all the Culture books, finding only <i>Matter</i> disappointing, with <em>Surface Detail</em> the most fun. In my own view, <em>Inversions</em> is the most unusual, but perhaps the most subtle.

The title novella forming the greater part of the <em>State of the Art</em> collection is of particular interest, for two reasons: it is in some ways the most accessible of the Culture series, by its explicit contrast with an Earth of the 1970s and, as the <em><a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/banks_iain_m">SFE</a></em> puts it, &quot;for the only time, it openly advocates some aspects of the Culture as a model for human behaviour.&quot;

For the anonymous author of <a href="http://www.afed.org.uk/org/org81.pdf">'Beyond Perfection'</a>,

"The point of this anarchist utopia [i.e. the Culture] is not that there’s some ignored power relation at work that compromises its integrity, or even that you can have too much of a good thing. It’s a more subtle and complex message about inertia and entropy, of the nature of power and privilege, and the need for change and development, personal and societal, even in the face of seeming perfection."

For Martin H., writing in <em>Workers Solidarity</em> in 2000, "Banks clearly knew his anarchism", and the Culture series "flesh out what it might be like to live in an anarchist society."
