<em>Patternmaster</em> is one of the weakest of Butler's  novels, but is nevertheless included in Mark Bould's Red Planets reading list (see bibliography), and is in Dukan's <a href="http://invisibleuniversedoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IU_BSF_lit_2015_3000.jpg"> bibliography</a> as an early work from the first generation of Black Futurists.
 
<em>Kindred</em> is probably Butler's best-known work, and  is by now pretty much a standard text, featuring a complex critique of race and  power relationships in the ante-bellum South, from the viewpoint of an  African-American woman from 1976, who is intermittently pulled back to 1815  whenever her slave-owning white forebear is in danger.
 
_Wild Seed_ is the last of Butler's _Patternist_ series. Lewis Call devotes a couple of pages to this work in 'Structures of desire', his chapter in Hecker and Cleminson, eds: _Anarchism & Sexuality_. He sees the novel as "a sadomasochistic love story," in which Butler discovered "a kind of erotic play-slavery," which she presents as "an effective strategic and symbolic challenge to a principal character's "ugly, empire-building slavery." He concludes that "A text would have to be kinky _and_ postanarchist to achieve something like that."

Dawn's most daring maneuver was not the  unattractive aliens on the breathing bio-ship that rescued the xenophobic humans  after a human holocaust—nor even the seemingly benevolent freaks' rejection of  humanity's apparently inherent hierarchies; rather, Butler busted boundaries  with bizarre, kinky, and blissfully psychedelic interspecies sex. Even though  the humans cannot help but like it, do they really want it? As one might  imagine, the issue of permission is problematic here; do the humans choose to  breed with their apparently terrifying and tentacled saviors and captors? Is  this patronizing servitude masked as emancipation?

The Xenogenesis stories have also been  recommended on the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/anarchismandsciencefiction/search/?query=butler"> Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum</a>. But <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2020/05/30/review-great-utopian-and-dystopian-works-of-literature-pamela-bedore/"> Zeke Teflon</a> has added a corrective, stressing that the the view that the trilogy is a flawed utopia is "grotesque".
 
The two Parable books chart the  rise of a movement based on mutual aid (or just common human decency) amid the  breakdown of society in the United  States. Warm and literate, it's unfortunate that the author chose to hang her  principles on a new religion.
 
Butler's work, and especially the <em>Parable</em> novels, were featured in articles in her memory, by Anu Bonobo and Benjamin  Carson, in <em>Fifth Estate</em> in 2006. While Bonobo focuses on her Afrofuturism,  Carson, while relishing the mutual aid depicted, finds Butler's orientation  towards a future in space "deeply troubling".
 
Bonobo, in <em>Fifth Estate</em> #<a href="http://www.fifthestate.org/archive/373-fall-2006/octavia-estelle-butler/">373</a>,  speaks of the vampire collectives of Fledgling as "bloodlinked free love  communes—of a sort. But since the symbionts need the vampire kiss like a junky  needs his needle, it’s difficult to define this as a liberated relationship."  <em>Fledgling</em> is included in the Think Galactic <a href="http://thinkgalactic.org/reading-lists/by-author/">reading list</a> as  well as the Swindon Anarchist Group's list of <a href="https://swindonanarchistgroup.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/anarchistresistance-novels/"> anarchist/resistance novels</a>.
