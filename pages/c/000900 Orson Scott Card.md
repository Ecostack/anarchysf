Of the Tales of Alvin Maker series, beginning with Seventh Son, Toni Bloodworth, in a 2000 posting to the original AnarchySF mailing list, wrote:

"The series seems to me about how spirituality, fully lived, leads us to try to be active in the world and try to create a humane society. Yes, Card is a Mormon, a sect of Christianity I find problematic at best, but he comes across as far more tolerant than most Mormons."
