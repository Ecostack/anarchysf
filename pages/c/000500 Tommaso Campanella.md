This classic utopia was seen straightforwardly by Max Nettlau, in his _Short History_, as authoritarian and  statist. <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ethel-mannin-bread-and-roses?fbclid=IwAR3pOu9LfYzQZJmMe_vW_AklJFThPZy29ZoVk2ervsvzhFvBqogyz0LTe7I">Ethel Mannin</a>, too, cut straight to the chase, declaring that it is in the "Platonic Fascist tradition". But Berneri was somewhat more  charitable, in the 14 pages she devoted to the work. She noted that it

. . . "is the first utopia which gives a leading role to  natural sciences. It is also the first utopia which abolishes slave labour and  considers all manual work, however humble it may now appear, as an honourable  duty. As in other utopias, however, there is little freedom in the City of the  Sun."

However, given Campanella's own experience of years of  imprisonment courtesy of the Roman Catholic church, she noted that "not  unnaturally, Campanella bans prisons and torture from his ideal city."  Nevertheless, given that the utopia was intended as a political blueprint, she  found it "arid and uninspiring."
