Explores an attractive anarchist society in a post-collapse 22nd  century San Francisco. Anu Bonobo, in <a href="http://www.fifthestate.org/archive/370-fall-2005/after-the-deluge-processed-world/">Fifth Estate</a>,  described it as "more an imaginary treasure map than  utopia-by-the-numbers blueprint . . .". Carlsson, in the acknowledgments,  depicts the novel simply: "a stab at describing the world I'd like to wake up  into."
