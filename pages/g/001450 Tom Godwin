This much-anthologised tale is discussed in a long paragraph of Jesse Cohn's 
<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jesse-cohn-anarchism-and-the-crisis-of-representation">Anarchism and the Crisis of Representation</a>, 
where he notes that "contextually speaking, Godwinâ€™s vision of the future is really a reflection of its own present, a distorted representation of 
Eisenhower-era gender codes that projects these onto the universe itself, rewriting social conventions as natural law."
