'The Yellow Wallpaper' is a powerful feminist story: a first-person account of a woman's mental health fragmenting in the face of the 'rest cure' prescribed by her patriarchal physician husband. Described by China Mi√©ville, in his 'Fifty Fantasy & Science Fiction Works That Socialists Should Read' (copied to the anarchysf mailing list in 2005) as "terrifying," and a "Towering work by this radical thinker."

_Herland_ is an interesting and surprisingly readable lost-race story of  an all-woman utopia, but for Jesse Cohn, writing 99 years after its original  publication, it is "decidedly non-anarchist" (221).
