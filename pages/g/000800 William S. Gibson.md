Idoru's Walled City "presents us with a new model of anarchist politics, for it insists that truly radical activities cannot be carried out within the epistemological framework of modern spatial relations" (<a href="Shelley,%20Mary">Call</a>: 105).  For <a href="biblio.htm#Sheehan">Seán Sheehan</a>, however, "Cyberpunk is partly  characterized by neat, throw-away concepts like the Walled City, but such ideas  hardly constitute an attempt to dismantle the bourgeois forms of reality,  especially when they occur within novels like Idoru that are utterly  conventional in their narrative form."
 
Rich Dana (Ricardo Feral) quoted from <i>All Tomorrow&#39;s Parties</i> in his &#39;Feral Technology&#39; piece for <i>Fifth Estate</i> #405, Winter 2020.

A rather questionable link here, but <a href="http://mises.org/library/friedrich-hayek-and-american-science-fiction"> Jeff Riggenbach</a> has traced a perceived influence on Pattern Recognition  from the neoliberal economist Friedrich Hayek.
