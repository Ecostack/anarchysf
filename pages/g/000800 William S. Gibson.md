_Idoru_'s Walled City "presents us with a new model of anarchist politics, for it insists that truly radical activities cannot be carried out within the epistemological framework of modern spatial relations" (Call (1999): 105).  For Seán Sheehan (2003), however, "Cyberpunk is partly  characterized by neat, throw-away concepts like the Walled City, but such ideas  hardly constitute an attempt to dismantle the bourgeois forms of reality,  especially when they occur within novels like _Idoru_ that are utterly  conventional in their narrative form."
 
Rich Dana (Ricardo Feral) quoted from _All Tomorrow's Parties_ in his 'Feral Technology' piece for _Fifth Estate_ #405, Winter 2020.

A rather questionable link here, but <a href="http://mises.org/library/friedrich-hayek-and-american-science-fiction"> Jeff Riggenbach</a> has traced a perceived influence on _Pattern Recognition_  from the neoliberal economist Friedrich Hayek.
