Grave was a notable activist in the French anarchist and international anarchist communism movements, and the editor of three major anarchist periodicals, _Le Révolté, La Révolte_ and _Les Temps Nouveaux_. Among his books was this short fantasy, described in the 2014 _Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary_ as a "libertarian utopia for children". Nettlau, in his [Esbozo](https://materialesfopep.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/max-nettlau-esbozo-de-historia-de-las-utopc3adas.pdf), notes that this was used as a second reading book in Ferrer's Modern School in Barcelona, which opened in the year of its publication.

The text itself is no longer of any great interest, however.
