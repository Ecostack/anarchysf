Rebellion against tyranny aboard a generation starship. Fairly familiar territory, but this is an exceptional debut novel with a very original take, and a fierce and feisty protagonist.

The author's own <a href="https://www.riverssolomon.com/bio">website</a> says, in no uncertain terms, "Rivers Solomon is a dyke, an anarchist, a she-beast, an exile, a shiv, a wreck, and a refugee of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. They write about life in the margins, where they are much at home."

The novel is a principal subject of one of the <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/An-Unkindness-of-Ghosts-and-the-Love-of-Saying-No-eof145">anarchysf podcasts</a>.
