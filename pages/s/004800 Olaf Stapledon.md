One of the most important figures in the history of science fiction, Stapledon (like H.G. Wells) was a democratic socialist, who believed (also like Wells) that state socialism would and should develop into a stateless society. In _Last and First Men_ and _StarMaker_ this development is briefly portrayed. (Dan Clore)
