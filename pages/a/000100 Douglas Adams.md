Suggested as anarchist reading by a poster to <a href="http://libcom.org/forums/introductory/anarchism-suggested-reading?page=2">libcom.org</a>.

In its irreverence of authority and its absurdism, <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> can certainly hold interest for the anarchist reader. Within its pages, it seems that no hierarchy, no political structure, no matter how big or small, doesn't hold some form of corruption within it. Whether the crass and brutal lack of empathy of the Vogons, the mind-numbing bureaucracy of local, municipal government, or the start-system encompassing absurdism of the galactic governance, all the systems in these books are a mockery of rigid, segmented power-structures and their traps.

In their place, individual empathy, perseverance and ingenuity are often suggested or expanded upon. However, it should be noted that, as part of its satirical voice, there are no firm political alternatives suggested within the series. The fact that it's very good more than makes up for that.
