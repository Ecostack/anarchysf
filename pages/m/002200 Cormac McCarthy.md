Superlative post-apocalyptic novel, but Jesse Cohn sees it  as one of a number of scenarios of disaster substituting for popular radical  narratives in the context of the ongoing global economic crisis (391). Leona, in _The BASTARD Chronicles 2015_, similarly includes _The Road_ among her  examples of "the embrace of hopelessness and alienation" that we should be wary  of.
