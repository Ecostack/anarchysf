Superhero YA novel (<em>young</em> YA, I would say). Action takes place in the aftermath of conflict between two groups of people with superpowers, known as the Anarchists and the Renegades, of which the latter consider themselves superheroes and the 'good guys'. In fact neither faction is particularly attractive, though probably Meyer intends the reader to understand that there's good and bad on both sides. The so-called Anarchists seem to have very little to do with anarchism, in any case.
