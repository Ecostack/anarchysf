Set in Melbourne in the mid-21st century, with the full impact of global warming in evidence as the oceans rise. The novel is discussed at length in a three-part article by <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/australian-science-fiction-great-george-turner-part-i/">Zeke Teflon</a>, who describes it as "the first, or at least the first major, novel to deal head on with climate change"; in another Sharp and Pointed <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2020/05/30/review-great-utopian-and-dystopian-works-of-literature-pamela-bedore/">review</a> he calls it "a literary masterpiece," "the first, and probably best, climate-change-disaster novel."
