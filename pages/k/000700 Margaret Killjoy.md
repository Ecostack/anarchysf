<a href="http://www.tangledwilderness.org/a-country-of-ghosts/">_A Country of Ghosts_</a> isn't sf, but Killjoy's contemporary take on an anarchist  utopia has to be welcomed here. For Nick Mamatas, in _The BASTARD Chronicles  2015_, the book is "pretty interesting", but gets "really good" in the final  third, when war comes to the stateless utopia.
 
_The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion_ is also more a  gothic fantasy novella, but anarchists and anarchism are central to the story.
