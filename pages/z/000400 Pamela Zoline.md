Superb new wave story viewing a housewife's routine of domestic drudgery as an analogue of entropy itself.

Included in Jesse Cohn's <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1735622/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_ENGL_373_?auto=download">Science Fiction and Fantasy</a> syllabus. Included in Bould's _Red Planets_ reading list.

In my view this has to be in the running for the greatest sf short story ever written.
