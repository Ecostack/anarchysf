_The Day of The Triffids_ is a well-known disaster story centring on murderous plants. In _The Kraken Wakes_ 4/5 of the world population dies from the onslaught of aliens who invade the ocean deeps. Both novels were named by D.R. in _Freedom_'s 1958 review of Maine's _The Tide Went Out_, as earlier examples of the same genre.
