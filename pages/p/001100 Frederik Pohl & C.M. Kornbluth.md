One of the best-known of 1950s SF novels, the cynical dystopia of _The Space Merchants_ is a strong attack on advertising and consumerism; for the advertising company boss,  "'Power ennobles. Absolute power ennobles absolutely'" (c. 4). For M. Eagle  "There can be few more biting (or amusing) satires of capitalism-gone-wild"; and Vittorio Curtoni also found it  "a most enjoyable novel which dismantles and overturns [the] mechanisms of cosmic imperialism." (25)
Â 
_Gladiator-at-Law_ features big-business intrigue, in which a house-production monopoly is overthrown by a motley crew of the dispossessed. Pilgrim found it notable, and unusual in that the insurrection is successful. (Pilgrim 1963: 371)
