Vittorio Curtoni called the 1955 story a "great  masterpiece", "like a Kafkaesque nightmare transposed to our days." (Curtoni  1978) Bould's _Red Planets_ lists this story and  'The Midas Plague' as "Among the very best 1950s SF satires."

_The Years of the City_ depicts New York in the 21st  century. The political system is what is known as 'demarchy', a form of decentralized  participatory democracy in which  all government offices are filled by average citizens chosen using a form of  selective service, with an overall goal of reducing bureaucracy and legislation.
